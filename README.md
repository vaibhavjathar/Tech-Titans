# Tech-Titans

This program is designed to detect human faces using a webcam and also to detect faces in images.

## Tools & Technologies Used
1. Python
2. OpenCV
3. Haarcascade Classifier

## Features
- Detects faces in real-time using the webcam on your computer.
- Detects faces in static images, whether there is one face or multiple faces in the image.
- Enabled by computer vision, facial recognition can identify individual faces.

## How It Works
- The program uses OpenCV and the Haarcascade Classifier function to perform facial detection.
- For webcam detection, it accesses your computer's webcam to detect faces in real-time.
- For image detection, it applies the Haarcascade Classifier to detect frontal faces in provided images.

## Compatibility
- Compatible with various operating systems.
- Can be used with different code editors.
